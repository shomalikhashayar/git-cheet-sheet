| :- | :- | :- |
git log git remote add [alias] [url]

show the commit history for the currently active branch add a git URL as an alias

git log branchB..branchA git fetch [alias]

show the commits on branchA that are not on branchB fetch down all the branches from that Git remote

git log --follow [file] git merge [alias]/[branch]

show the commits that changed ﬁle, even across renames merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date

git diff branchB...branchA git push [alias] [branch]

show the diﬀ of what is in branchA that is not in branchB Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch

git show [SHA] git pull

show any object in Git in human-readable format fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch

git log --stat -M

show all commit logs with indication of any paths that moved TEMPORARY COMMITS

Temporarily store modiﬁed, tracked ﬁles in order to change branches
